## About

MultiRow for ASP.NET MVC supports a transposed view, which is another way to show tabular data and especially useful when there are few data items. The transposed multi-row aspect repeats the records horizontally instead of vertically like in a traditional grid.

The TransposedMultiRow control extends the FlexGrid control to display data using a transposed layout, where columns represent data items and rows represent item properties, similar to the TransposedGrid control. But in contrast to the TransposedGrid control, the TransposedMultiRow control uses multiple columns to represent each data item. This allows you to create form-like interfaces that can display a large number of rows with minimal vertical scrolling.
