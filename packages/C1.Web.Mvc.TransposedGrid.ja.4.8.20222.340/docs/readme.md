## About

In regular grids, each item is represented by a row with columns that represent the item properties. Whereas, in transposed grids, each item is represented by a column with rows that represent the item properties. TransposedGrid is a FlexGrid extension that supports a grid where the rows and columns are transposed.

MVC allows you to work with the transposed grids by using the TransposedGrid class. This class allows the grid control to display data using a transposed layout, where columns represent data items and rows represent item properties. In such transposed grids, the column headers appear on the left side of the grid. each item is represented by a column with rows that represent the item properties.
